# General conventions

## OMOP CDM
### Version
PIONEER datasets are converted to [OMOP CDM V6.0.0](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki) plus [oncology extensions](https://github.com/OHDSI/OncologyWG/wiki).
The *Episode* and *Episode Event* tables are added to the OMOP CDM. 
In addition, the fields ``modifier_of_event`` and ``modifier_of_field_concept_id`` are added to the *Measurement* table.

## OMOP Vocabularies
### Version
The latest OMOP vocabulary can be downloaded from [Athena](http://athena.ohdsi.org/).
The version loaded on the central PIONEER server can be found by going to the [Atlas Configuration](https://pioneer-atlas.thehyve.net/#/configure) page 
(at the time of writing this is `v5.0 01-AUG-19`). 

### Vocabularies
The following OMOP vocabularies are used in the PIONEER mappings:
- OMOP generated (Gender, Race, Type Concepts)
- SNOMED
- LOINC
- NAACCR (note: NAACCR is not included in the Athena download by default, and should be selected manually)
- UCUM

### Mapping
Terms found in the source data are mapped to concepts in the OMOP standard vocabularies to achieve semantic interoperability. In most cases a mapping to a standard concept with the same meaning as the source term can be made. If this is not possible, we map the source term to a non-standard concept. If there is also no non-standard concept matching the source term, then we create a custom 'PIONEER' concept.

To summarise, we have the following three options for semantic mapping, with decreasing priority:
1. Mapping to a standard concept. If multiple standard concepts match, use the concept from the SNOMED vocabulary where possible.
2. Mapping to a non-standard concept
3. Mapping to a custom PIONEER concept

### Custom vocabulary
Whenever appropriate concepts are missing in the OMOP Vocabulary, custom concepts are used.
These custom concepts are aligned within PIONEER. 
The PIONEER custom vocabulary can be found [here](https://github.com/thehyve/ohdsi-omop-pioneer/blob/master/pioneer_custom_vocabulary/pioneer_concepts.csv).

If a custom concept is added to the PIONEER custom vocabulary, and this custom concept becomes obsolete in a later stage of the ETL development process, 
the custom concept is not removed from the PIONEER custom vocabulary but is assigned a "D" (Deleted) in the ``standard_concept`` column of the PIONEER custom vocabulary file.  

### Other conventions
* [Concept id 4163261](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4163261) ('Malignant tumor of prostate') is used to record a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

## Syntactic mapping

### Date
- Populate both the `_date` (required in v5) and the `_datetime` (required in v6) fields. If there is not time component, set the time to `00:00:00`.
- When only year is stored in the data (and month and day are missing), the first of July (07-01) is used as a proxy. This day will be, on average, the closest to the actual date.
- When year is not stored in the dataset, the following steps and conventions are followed:
	1. In general, if the date is entirely missing, skip the record. 
	2. If decided to map the record (for example the record is essential to preserve):
       1. Try to derive year from the context, for example take the data of a related procedure when mapping a conditioning regimen.
       2. If year can not be derived, use ``1970-01-01`` for both ``start_date`` and ``end_date``.
       3. In case of medical history: capture as 'History of' and use date of capturing this medical history.
	   
	   Exception: When ``observation_period.observation_period_end_date can`` not be derived, take last date of ETL run.

### Condition Occurrence
In some cases the primary diagnosis is not captured in the data itself, but has to derived from the protocol. 
For instance in ERSPC, the diagnosis of prostate cancer is not recorded separately (only a year of PCa diagnosis is given).
In that case a condition occurrence record "Malignant tumor of prostate" ([4163261](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4163261)) is stored.
If the status is equal to BCR, the concept "Non-metastatic prostate cancer" ([37208188](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/37208188)) is stored.

### Care site & Location
Due to privacy reasons, the exact care site and location values are not mapped to the corresponding OMOP tables. 

### CDM Source
The name and location of the dataset are not captured in the `cdm_source` table.
A record is created in this table, with the ETL date, source extraction date, ETL reference, vocab version and OMOP CDM version.

### Death date
The death date is stored twice.
This redundancy is required for compatibility with both OMOP CDM v5 and v6.
To capture a death, we have to:

1. Create a record in the death table with at least the `person_id` and `death_date`. 
   This may also include the primary cause of death.
2. Update the person record and set the `death_datetime`. 
   If no time granularity available, use _00:00:00_ as the time component.

Contributory causes of death can be stored in the CONDITION table.

### Type concept
Every event table (e.g. condition_occurrence, observation) has a `_type_concept` field, which stores the record provenance.
The main purpose is to determine the reliability of the record. A few types with increasing reliability:
- Self-reported
- healthcare professional filled
- Registry / Study / EHR

A list of valid type concepts can be found [here](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?vocabulary=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=).
For example, data from the ERSPC and PRIAS studies have type [32879 - Registry](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/32879).

### Study Visits
We have defined multiple custom concepts to capture the full granularity of study visits.
For example:

 - Screening visit #1-5 (2000000001-2000000005)
 - Baseline visit (2000000048)
 - Follow-up visit #1-38 (2000000049-2000000086)

Please capture the visit information as detailed as possible with the concepts given in [the PIONEER custom concepts](https://github.com/thehyve/ohdsi-omop-pioneer/blob/master/pioneer_custom_vocabulary/pioneer_concepts.csv).

### Person
The following conventions are used for the mapping to the Person table.
- Birth date: Only the Year of Birth is required. Month of Birth may be given and can be mapped. Day of Birth should not be mapped, even if it is available. 
- Race or Ethnicity are generally not recorded and concepts are mapped to 0.

### Episodes
As explained in the [Oncology extension wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/OncologyWG/wiki/Cancer-Models-Representation#representation-of-disease-and-treatment-episodes),
the `episode` and `episode_event` tables can be used to link events to a disease stage or treatment.
In a more broad sense, these tables allow you to group events together when clinically relevant.

E.g. for PRIAS, these episode tables are used to group related measurement and observation events
if they originate from the same lesion or core biopsy.

### Measurement Modifiers
When a particular piece of information about an event cannot be captured independently,
nor are the existing table fields suitable,
it should be captured as a measurement modifier.

This could for example be used to store a severity indicator for a
reported condition, e.g. `measurement_concept_id = 4087703` (Severe),
`modifier_of_event_id = 1` (PK value of condition_occurrence_id),
`modifier_of_field_concept_id = 1147127` (indicates it refers to field condition_occurrence.condition_occurrence_id).
For more information on measurement modifiers see [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/OncologyWG/wiki/MEASUREMENT).

### Negatives
If the source data contains information on negatives
(e.g. a specific condition a patient was not diagnosed with, or a procedure not performed),
it should in principle not be captured in the OMOP CDM.
Only if a negative is needed to support a particular use case,
should it be stored as an observation with `concept_id` =
[No evidence of](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4211787),
whereas the mapped value (e.g. a condition) is stored in `value_as_concept_id`.
